Your Ember.js project is almost ready! Here's how to get started:

- Change lang="en" in the <html> tag if your page is not in English

- Fill:
  <title></title>
  <meta name="description" content="">
  <meta name="author" content="">

- Change the favicons

- Start writing your app in js/app.js.

- Describe your application HTML in index.html.

- During development, you can link to ember-*.js to get the
  unminified version of Ember.js.

- Make a 404.html page if you have a 404 redirection in your server configuration file

== Recommendations and usage =====

- Use CSS versioning to force the cache refresh:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css?v=[current_version]">
